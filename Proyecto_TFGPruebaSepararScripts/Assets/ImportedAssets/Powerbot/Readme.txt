Thank you for purchasing Powerbot.
Powerbot contains 14 variations (combining geometry and material variations) of the same character
and 30 animations using the same rig.

To use Powerbot in your project go the prefab folder and drag one of the prefabs in your scene.

In order to make it move you will need to add an script to tell to the animator which animation to play.

All the animations are already split in clips (see animacion clip section).
for more information on how to use mecanim follow this tutorial:

I hope you like this asset!

FOLDERS:

  It also contains the Material Folder

    - Materials

	   It contains the materials used to create the variations of the character.


- Prefab Characters

   Contains the prefabs to be used in the game.
   They are already prepared with the right materials and the animator component.
   There are 14 variations to be used as different skins for the main character or as enemies as well.



- Scenes

   The scene with all the prefabs line up.


- Shaders

   The shader for the body of the character.
   It's a custom build shader to achieve a metallic material with reflection and rim light.


- Textures

   There are 5 textures and a cubemap.

   Blue with difuse and specular,
   Red with difuse and specular,
   white with difuse and specular (used to be multiplied so it can generate other colors easily)
   Normal map to achive the extra details of the bump,
   and reflection to be used in the reflection slot in the material, it's also be used to create the cubemap.

ANIMATION

All the animation clips are splited in the Animations file inside the Models folder.
The model change position in the animation, to play the animation in the same spot (not moving)
select the clip you want to change and "Bake Into Pose" should be clicked.

Also in the Prefab you should have "Apply Root Motion" unchecked if you want to move your character by code
instead of using the motion in the animation.
